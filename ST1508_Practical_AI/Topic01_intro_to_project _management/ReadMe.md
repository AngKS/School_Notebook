## Part 01: Agile Project Management

### What is a Project?
Projects are activities that are:
- **Temporary** (Has a clear start and expected end date)
- **Unique** (Involves something new, not repetitive, strives for some novelty)
- **Risky** (Involves unknowns and therefore involves risks)

### Common Project Terminologies

| Terminology | Description |
|:--- | :--- |
| **Deliverables** | Tangible 'things' that the project aims to produce |
| **Milestones** | Dates set for a project deliverables should be completed/or have been completed. |
| **Tasks** | Activities that are undertaken for, and during, the project. |
| **Risks** | Potential problems that may arise during the project. |
| **Issues** | Actual problems that occur during the project |
| **Stakeholders** | People that may have interests in, or are affected by the project |

- The traditional way of carrying out projects is done in a sequential series of phases:
    1. Requirement Analysis
    2. Design
    3. Code
    4. Integration
    5. Testing
    6. Deployment
- The process flows exclusively in 1 direction > DOWNWARDS, hence like a waterfall
- Each phase must be fully completed before we start the next phase.
- Depends on requirements determined early on in the project
- Scope, Time and Costs are estimated at the beginning for the entire project.

#### Challenges of Waterfall Project Management

- The Product is only Validated at the end of the project
- Not flexible for changes in user requirements that may occur later in the project.
- Over reliance on documentation
