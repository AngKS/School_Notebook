## Part 01: Agile Project Management

### What is a Project?
Projects are activities that are:
- **Temporary** (Has a clear start and expected end date)
- **Unique** (Involves something new, not repetitive, strives for some novelty)
- **Risky** (Involves unknowns and therefore involves risks)

### Common Project Terminologies

| Terminology | Description |
|:--- | :--- |
| **Deliverables** | Tangible 'things' that the project aims to produce |
| **Milestones** | Dates set for a project deliverables should be completed/or have been completed. |
| **Tasks** | Activities that are undertaken for, and during, the project. |
| **Risks** | Potential problems that may arise during the project. |
| **Issues** | Actual problems that occur during the project |
| **Stakeholders** | People that may have interests in, or are affected by the project |

### Waterfall Project Management

- The traditional way of carrying out projects is done in a sequential series of phases:
    1. Requirement Analysis
    2. Design
    3. Code
    4. Integration
    5. Testing
    6. Deployment
- The process flows exclusively in 1 direction > DOWNWARDS, hence like a waterfall
- Each phase must be fully completed before we start the next phase.
- Depends on requirements determined early on in the project
- Scope, Time and Costs are estimated at the beginning for the entire project.

#### Challenges of Waterfall Project Management

- The Product is only Validated at the end of the project
- Not flexible for changes in user requirements that may occur later in the project.
- Over reliance on documentation

### SCRUM(AGILE) Project Management

![SCRUM Diagram](https://github.com/AngKS/School_Notebook/blob/master/ST1508_Practical_AI/Topic01_intro_to_project%20_management/assets/SCRUM.png)

- In SCRUM, projects are carried out in a series of stage that are called 'Sprints'
- Each Sprint in itself is like a condensed "waterfall cycle" with the aim to produce the next 'potentially shippable product'
- The Sprints will allow for early development and testing of features with the opportunity to also get early feedback from end-users, clients and stakeholders.

#### SCRUM Project Management Method
>Aims to produce an Incremental Potential 'shippable product' every sprint

- SCRUM is an agile project management method commonly used for rapid project development.
- SCRUM works best for small teams of about 3 to 10 members.
- SCRUM is a commonly adopted project management method for IT related development projects.

#### HOW-TO SCRUM
- In SCRUM, the work are broken down into time-frame iterations, called SPRINTS; the objecttive of each Sprint is to produce an incremental product called a 'potential shippable product'. Sprints typically lasts anywhere between 1 week to 2 months.
- Each Sprint starts with a Sprint Planning meeting. The team then tracks their progress through daily meetings, called Daily Scrums.
- At the end of each Sprint, the team holds 2 meetings. Firstly, a **Sprint Review** meeting(To Demonstrate the work done). Secondly, a **Sprint Retrospective** meeting(to discuss on how to improve on how the team carries out the SCRUM processes).

### SCRUM Team
| Role | Description |
|:--- | :--- |
| Product Owner | - Responsible for Product Vision and Return of Investment (ROI)<br>- Has final Decision on what are the features to be developed<br>- Focusses more on 'what needs to be done' than 'how things need to be done' |
| SCRUM Development Team | - Multi-Disciplinary, and Self-Organizing Group<br>- Main focus is to produce incremental "Potential Shippable" products at every Sprint<br>- Works closely together in tight-nit groups on daily basis |
| SCRUM Master | - Facilitates the daily scrum operations<br>- Liaises between the stakeholders and the SCRUM team<br>- Shields the development team form distractions |



### Waterfall vs Agile

| Waterfall Approach | Agile methadology |
|:--- | :--- |
| Starts with a clear picture of the product at the start | Picture of the product starts to evolve over time |
| Changes are not encouraged and are formally controlled | Changes are expected and embraces |
| Quality achieved through careful planning at beginning of the project | Quality achieved through incremental improvements |

### Product Backlog

A product backlog is a 'wish list' of prioritised requirements that a Scrum team set themselves to implement.

- Items on the product backlog are referred to as PBIs (Product Backlog Items)
- The PBIs are written in the form of User Stories and are meant to capture the various users requirements.
- The Product Owner owns the Product backlog and will work together with the Scrum team to update the Product backlog regularly.

### Users Stories

>User Stories are helpful to capture the 3 essentials of any user requirementm, namely: the **WHO**, **WHAT** and **WHY**.

User Stories are written in this format:
```
As a ___(user)___, I need ___(feature)___ so that ___(reason)___.
```

Each user stories are often written on cards for each single PBI, appropriately called 'User Story Cards'.

### Sprint Backlog/ Task Board

>A Sprint Backlog is a list of PBIs that are to be completed during the Sprint.

- Each PBI in the backlog will be further worked out into working tasks.
- The working tasks will then be placed on a Sprint Task board with 3 columns:
  1. Not Started
  2. In Progress
  3. Completed

### Sprint Planning Meeting

Each Sprint typically starts with a Sprint Meeting (around 1/2 hours) with the Objective to select a series of PBIs from the Product Backlog to be completed during the sprint. The team will then commit to these PBIs and place them on the Sprint Backlog.

The team will break down each PBIs into sub-tasks and place these tasks on a 'Sprint Task Board'

### Daily SCRUM Meeting
- Teams conduct Daily Scrum Meetings(aka Stand-Up meeting) every morning to discuss on their individual progress (+/- 15 minutes)
- SCRUM master will request each member to quickly report on 3 questions:
  1. What did I do yesteday?
  2. What will I do today?
  3. What impedes me?

### Sprint Review Meeting
>Demonstrates the work done during the Sprint 
- The Sprint Review meeting is conducted at the end of each Sprint (+/- 2 to 3 hours)
- The team will come together as to demonstrate to stake holders & clients the latest 'shippable product'.
- Objective of this meeting it to gather feedbacks and to provide stakeholders & clients an opportunity to actually try out the system.

### Sprint Retrospective Meeting
>Summarize what went well and what can be improved with regards to running the sprints
- The Sprint Retrospective meeting is also conducted at the end of each Sprint (+/- 1 to 1.5 hours)
- The team will come together to discuss how well did they apply the Scrum processes during this Sprint.
- Objective of this meeting is summarize what went well and what can be improved with refards to running the Sprints. An action plan for enhancement will be spelled out.

### Backlog Refinement Meeting
- Backlog Refinement meetings are conducted on demand (only when needed), and initiated by the Product Owner.
- Meeting is meant to have relook at all the PBIs in the product backlog.
- Specifically it aims to clarify on vague PBIs, remove redundant PBIs, add new PBIs or even break down larger PBIs in smaller ones.
