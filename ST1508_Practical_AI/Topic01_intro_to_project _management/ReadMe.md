## Part 01: Agile Project Management

### What is a Project?
Projects are activities that are:
- **Temporary** (Has a clear start and expected end date)
- **Unique** (Involves something new, not repetitive, strives for some novelty)
- **Risky** (Involves unknowns and therefore involves risks)

### Common Project Terminologies

| Terminology | Description |
|:--- | :--- |
| **Deliverables** | Tangible 'things' that the project aims to produce |
| **Milestones** | Dates set for a project deliverables should be completed/or have been completed. |
| **Tasks** | Activities that are undertaken for, and during, the project. |
| **Risks** | Potential problems that may arise during the project. |
| **Issues** | Actual problems that occur during the project |
| **Stakeholders** | People that may have interests in, or are affected by the project |

### Waterfall Project Management

- The traditional way of carrying out projects is done in a sequential series of phases:
    1. Requirement Analysis
    2. Design
    3. Code
    4. Integration
    5. Testing
    6. Deployment
- The process flows exclusively in 1 direction > DOWNWARDS, hence like a waterfall
- Each phase must be fully completed before we start the next phase.
- Depends on requirements determined early on in the project
- Scope, Time and Costs are estimated at the beginning for the entire project.

#### Challenges of Waterfall Project Management

- The Product is only Validated at the end of the project
- Not flexible for changes in user requirements that may occur later in the project.
- Over reliance on documentation

### SCRUM(AGILE) Project Management

![SCRUM Diagram](https://github.com/AngKS/School_Notebook/blob/master/ST1508_Practical_AI/Topic01_intro_to_project%20_management/assets/SCRUM.png)

- In SCRUM, projects are carried out in a series of stage that are called 'Sprints'
- Each Sprint in itself is like a condensed "waterfall cycle" with the aim to produce the next 'potentially shippable product'
- The Sprints will allow for early development and testing of features with the opportunity to also get early feedback from end-users, clients and stakeholders.

#### SCRUM Project Management Method
>Aims to produce an Incremental Potential 'shippable product' every sprint

- SCRUM is an agile project management method commonly used for rapid project development.
- SCRUM works best for small teams of about 3 to 10 members.
- SCRUM is a commonly adopted project management method for IT related development projects.

#### HOW-TO SCRUM
- In SCRUM, the work are broken down into time-frame iterations, called SPRINTS; the objecttive of each Sprint is to produce an incremental product called a 'potential shippable product'. Sprints typically lasts anywhere between 1 week to 2 months.
- Each Sprint starts with a Sprint Planning meeting. The team then tracks their progress through daily meetings, called Daily Scrums.
- At the end of each Sprint, the team holds 2 meetings. Firstly, a **Sprint Review** meeting(To Demonstrate the work done). Secondly, a **Sprint Retrospective** meeting(to discuss on how to improve on how the team carries out the SCRUM processes).

### Waterfall vs Agile

| Waterfall Approach | Agile methadology |
|:--- | :--- |
| Starts with a clear picture of the product at the start | Picture of the product starts to evolve over time |
| Changes are not encouraged and are formally controlled | Changes are expected and embraces |
| Quality achieved through careful planning at beginning of the project | Quality achieved through incremental improvements |
