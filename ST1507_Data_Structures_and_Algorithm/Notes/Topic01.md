## Data
> **Data** is a sequence of symbols that can be translated into information through an act of interpretation (or an act of analyses).

> **Metadata** is the context that allows us to translate data into information.

### Data and related terms

| Word | Meaning | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Data | A certain sequence of symbols that is open for interpretation |  |
| Information | Data that has been interpreted in the context of metadata | "Our ship is in distress, please help" |
| Knowledge | Theoretical/Practical understanding of a subject | "The captain and crew will be able to navigate our ship through these stormy weathers" |
| Wisdom | The ability to think and act using knowledge, experience, understanding, common sense and insights. | "As the captain of the ship, I have decided we will delay our journey for a day due to the bad weather forecasts." |

## Structures (Generic)

> A structure refers to the organization of a collection of related components that forms a whole, so it can support a certain function.

For instance, a man-made structure such as a building, is a collection of related parts, that are put together (organised) as to support a load bearing function (a brige, for instance).

## Structures (Computer Science)

> Data Structures describes a collection of data values, the relationships between these data values, and the functions that can be applied to these data values.

A data structure would need to support efficiency (in terms of storage and access) and flexibility.
