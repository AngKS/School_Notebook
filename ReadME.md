# AKS's Brain Dump ðŸ§  ðŸ¤–

Hi, This is th place where i try my very best to consolidate and sort out the mangled hot mess of information in my head.

I am looking into adding more notes/cheatsheets about stuffs outside of school... but for now its all school notes, so enjoy!

|Topic | Description |
| --- | --- |
|[CheatSheets](https://github.com/AngKS/School_Notebook/tree/master/CheatSheet) | Directory of Markdown shortcuts |
| [Fundamentals of Programming](https://github.com/AngKS/School_Notebook/tree/master/ST0502_Fundamentals_of_Programming) | Fundamentals of Programming in Javascript |
| [Programming for Data Analysis](https://github.com/AngKS/School_Notebook/tree/master/ST1510_Programming_for_Data_Analysis) | Basically the same as Fundamentals of Programming... Just PYTHON instead |
| [AI & Machine Learning](https://github.com/AngKS/School_Notebook/tree/master/ST1511_AI_and_Machine_Learning) | This is... a fat-ass mess |
| [Deep Learning](https://github.com/AngKS/School_Notebook/tree/master/ST1504_Deep_Learning) | I am thinking of writing short summaries and reports of the different neural networks (work in progress) |
| [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://github.com/AngKS/School_Notebook/tree/master/ST1507_Data_Structures_and_Algorithm) | Basically YeetCode |


** There are currently still alot of content with work in progress... so refer at your own risks :>

** Side note... i'm thinking of merging my [Back End Web Development workshop](https://github.com/AngKS/BED-Workshop) materials into this repository.
